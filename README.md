# Customer Satisfaction Page
A simple customer satisfaction webpage that tracks the number of clicks on 5 buttons to rate their experience.

Once the time is in a predetermined window (e.g. between 5pm and 8am) refreshing the page will reveal an admin 
control panel where the days results can be downloaded as a CSV including every button and the time it was clicked
along with totals for each button.
